Let me list all the terms/fields shown in the image:

1. Items (header)
2. Product Name
3. Purchase (button)
4. Sale (button)
5. HUID
6. HSN Name
7. Weight-related fields:
   - Gross Wt
   - Less Wt
   - Net Wt
   - Tounch (with % field)
   - Wastage (with % field)
8. Fine Weight
9. Rate
10. Making Type
11. Making Charge
12. Net Price
13. Charges section:
    - Example shown: "e.g. Labour Charge"
    - Example amount: "e.g. 500"
14. Tax section:

There's also an error message visible at the bottom:

The interface has navigation elements:
- BACK (top left)
- NEXT (top right)

All these fields appear to be part of a jewelry or precious metals related form interface, with various input fields for weights, charges, and specifications.

The user wants to know in which screens orders are being placed in the application. To answer this question, I need to explore the codebase to understand the structure and identify where order placement functionality is implemented.

First, let me get an overview of the project structure to understand what kind of files and directories we have:

I'll help you find where orders are being placed in the application. Let me first explore the structure of your codebase to understand the ordering system.

Ran tool
Let me look at the app directory which likely contains the main application code:

Ran tool
Let me check the src directory as well, since that's another common location for application code:

Ran tool
Great, I found a screens directory in the src folder, which is likely where the order placement screens would be located. Let's look at what screens are available:

Ran tool
I'm seeing several potentially relevant directories like "bills", "products", and possibly "home". Let's first check the "bills" directory as it might be related to orders:

Ran tool
Let's explore the "create" directory in bills, as this might be related to creating new orders/bills:

Ran tool
Let's look at the "products" directory as well, which might also be involved in the order process:

Ran tool
Now let's examine the main file in the bills/create directory, which is likely the main screen for creating orders:

Read file: src/screens/bills/create/index.jsx
Let's look at the remaining part of the file, especially the form submission and order placement logic:

Read file: src/screens/bills/create/index.jsx
Let's also check the Items.jsx file to understand how products are selected for the order:

Read file: src/screens/bills/create/Items.jsx
Let's also examine the Navigations.jsx file to understand the flow of screens:

Read file: src/Navigations.jsx
Let's check the different invoice screens mentioned in the navigation file, like SIScreen (Sale Invoice), PIScreen (Purchase Invoice), etc.:

Read file: src/screens/bills/SIScreen.jsx
Let's look at the OIScreen.jsx (Order Invoice) file as well:

Read file: src/screens/bills/OIScreen.jsx
Let's check the ORInvoiceForm component which is used in the Order Invoice screen:

Ran tool

Read file: src/components/ORInvoiceForm.jsx
Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can now answer your question about which screens are used for placing orders in the application.

The main screens where orders are being placed in your application are:

1. **Sale Invoice Screen (SIScreen.jsx)** 
   - This is for creating sales invoices/orders
   - It uses the CreateInvoice component with type="sale"

2. **Purchase Invoice Screen (PIScreen.jsx)**
   - This is for creating purchase invoices/orders
   - It uses the CreateInvoice component with type="purchase"

3. **Order Invoice Screen (OIScreen.jsx)**
   - This is specifically for creating order invoices
   - It uses the ORInvoiceForm component with type="order"

4. **Repairing Invoice Screen (RIScreen.jsx)**
   - This is for creating repair orders
   - It appears to also use a form component for repairs

5. **Loan Invoice Screen (LIScreen.jsx)**
   - This is for loan-related orders/invoices

The main implementation of the invoice/order creation is in:
- `src/screens/bills/create/index.jsx` - The main form for creating invoices
- `src/screens/bills/create/Items.jsx` - For adding items to the invoice/order
- `src/screens/bills/create/Extras.jsx` - For adding extra charges and details
- `src/components/ORInvoiceForm.jsx` - Specific form for order and repair invoices

The order creation process generally follows these steps:
1. Select a type of invoice/order (Sale, Purchase, Order, Repair, Loan)
2. Add products/items to the order
3. Add customer/contact information
4. Add additional charges, payment details, etc.
5. Submit the order which dispatches the addInvoice action

Is there a specific aspect of the order placement process you'd like more details about?
